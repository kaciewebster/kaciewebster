### Hi I'm Kacie, and I'm currently a student at the Galvanize Data Science Immersive.

I have a passion for problem solving and a knack for math and statistics. Data science is the perfect field to combine the two.

While I was completing my degree in statistics at San Diego State University, I developed an interest for data science. I completed projects covering a wide variety of topics. I worked on a statistical analysis of the relationship between the San Diego housing market and minimum wage. In addition, I developed a principal component analysis, cluster analysis and factorial analysis on the results of the 2020 NCAA men's basketball season (pre-COVID-19). These projects have taught me to have confidence in my abilities and how to utilize resources to help solve difficult problems.

I'm excited to apply what I have learned to help companies find unique solutions to their real world problems.
